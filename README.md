# pokesnake

This app crawls (hint: snakes crawl) various pokemon (hint: the first 4 letters
of pokemon are poke) websites to populate a filter friendly table catered to
certain versions of pokemon.

## Getting Started

Run the test suite with `rails test`, and assuming this passes, run the app
server with: `rails server`. Navigate to localhost:3000 in your browser,
and voila!

hint: this app is basically useless in its current form :)

## TODO

* Add a job (populate db)
* Create an API, return pokemon filtered by type
